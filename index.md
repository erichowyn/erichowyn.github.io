### CPSC 120A

*  Lab 6, Part 1 was a favorite because it was pretty cool to be able to make a Mad Lib sandwich game using C++. I was able to make it do 7 different test cases, being able to tell errors apart from actual orders. An example was when you had it do less than three arguments it would output an error message.

*  Lab 9, part 2 was another favorite because we were able to code a secret number game using c++. It was able to do 17 different test cases, being able to tell if you won, lost, and even tell you an error output. An example was when you put something else than a number it would say error malformed but when you choose the correct secret number it would say you won.

*  Lab 10, part 1 was another favorite because it was interesting to be able to code the population and percentage it makes up for the entire state. It was able to tell the population between the counties of California and give an accurate population of each one. So say Los Angeles for example, has a population of 9829544 for the county and that it makes up 25.05% of the entire state's population.
